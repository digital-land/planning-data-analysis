    "# Grouping and Clustering Invalid Application Reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This script processes and categorises **invalid application reasons** by grouping them into predefined themes, creating a structured Word document, and performing **clustering** with **TF-IDF vectorisation** and **TSNE visualisation**. The final output includes:\n",
    "1. A **Word document** summarising grouped reasons.\n",
    "2. A **CSV file** containing structured reasons.\n",
    "3. A **TSNE visualisation** of clustered reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this script was to automate the process of grouping similar invalid application reasons. As there isn't a obvious matching between the different reasons (apart from vague groupings such as missing a document, or not paid total amount), a simple matching procedure would not be sufficient. That is why we are using cluster analysis, which is a method of unsupervised machine learning. It is worth noting, this script only aims to provide a rough grouping of the data. If this was to be generalised for further datasets, it would be ideal to properly train and score a clustering model, to enusre high accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Load and Preprocess Data\n",
    "The script starts by **loading the dataset** containing invalid application reasons from a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theme-based classification**:\n",
    "- Reasons are **classified into predefined themes** using regular expressions (e.g., \"Missing Reports\", \"Incorrect Fee\", \"Missing Drawings\").\n",
    "- Any reason that does not fit a theme is placed in the `\"Other\"` category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subcategorisation of \"Incorrect Fee\"**:\n",
    "- The `\"Incorrect Fee\"` category is further split into:\n",
    "  - `\"Incorrect Fee - Underpayment\"` (if the reason contains words like `\"insufficient\"` or `\"further fee\"`).\n",
    "  - `\"Incorrect Fee - Other\"` (all remaining incorrect fee reasons).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Create a Structured Word Document\n",
    "A **Word document** is created to store grouped reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each theme is added as a **section heading** with the **number of occurrences**.\n",
    "- The `\"Incorrect Fee - Other\"` category includes additional **counts for underpayments**.\n",
    "- The document is saved as **`Grouped_Invalid_Reason_Details.docx`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Perform Text Clustering\n",
    "The script **clusters the reasons using machine learning techniques**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TF-IDF Vectorisation**:\n",
    "   - Converts text into numerical representations.\n",
    "   - Removes common stop words.\n",
    "   - Limits features to **500** for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction with TSNE**:\n",
    "   - Reduces **TF-IDF features to 2D** for visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **K-Means Clustering**:\n",
    "   - Groups reasons into **10 clusters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Visualise Clusters with TSNE\n",
    "The clusters are **plotted using TSNE**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The visualisation **color-codes clusters**.\n",
    "- The plot is **saved as `TSNE_Clusters.png`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Generate a CSV File with Grouped Reasons\n",
    "The script **creates a CSV file** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **theme becomes a column**.\n",
    "- Reasons **are stored in rows**, ensuring alignment by filling empty spaces with `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final **CSV file `Grouped_Invalid_Reason_Details.csv`** contains structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Outputs\n",
    "âœ… **`Grouped_Invalid_Reason_Details.docx`** â†’ A structured Word document grouping invalid reasons.  \n",
    "âœ… **`TSNE_Clusters.png`** â†’ A visualisation of clustered reasons.  \n",
