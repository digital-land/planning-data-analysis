Once the redline is revised to exclude unit 1 you will need to serve/re-serve notice on anyone who has an ownership interest in land contained within the revised redline and submit an updated ownership certificate ? this should be taken from the application form. In terms of the site plans these will need to be updated inline with the revised redline and resubmitted. When updating we need to be clear on which parking spaces will be allocated to the proposed gym. Therefore you should either only include the parking spaces that will be allocated to the gym within the updated redline plan/ site plans or alternatively if this is not possible you should update the site plans to show how the parking will be split between units 1 and 2 - this can be done using different coloured hashing or by annotating the spaces with 1 and 2 and adding a key.
